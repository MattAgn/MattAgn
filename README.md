<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matthieu</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate fullstack developer from France specialised in React Native</h3>
<p>My main passion is building mobile apps with React Native and everything related to quality and testing. I'm an external maintainer of [callstack/react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library)
<p>I love to try out new technologies. I had a lot of fun building small apps and games in Flutter, Elixir and Svelte</p>
